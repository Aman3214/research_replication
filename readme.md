# NeRF Replication Project

This repository contains the **NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)** model replication based on the original research paper. The implementation combines insights from the paper and additional guidance from online resources, including YouTube tutorials.

##  File Structure

### 1️ nerf/

-  Contains the **vanilla NeRF implementation** replicated from the research paper.
-  Includes the **training code** used for learning scene representations.
-  Stores the **weights** from the last training epoch for model evaluation.

### 2️ novel_view/

-  Contains **generated novel views** from the **synthetic LEGO dataset**.
-  The novel views are stored as **pickle files**:
  -  `training.pkl` – Contains novel views used during training.
  -  `testing.pkl` – Contains novel views used for evaluation.

### 3️⃣ requirements.txt

-  Lists all **additional dependencies** that must be installed before running the code.
-  Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

##  Getting Started

1️ **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/research_replication.git
   cd research_replication
   ```
2️ **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3️ **Run the training script** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python nerf/train.py
   ```
4️ **Generate novel views** using the trained model.
